Advent of Code 2021

## Setup

Make sure you have poetry and Python 3.10 installed. I recommend using something like pyenv to manage your Python versions.

1. Spawn a new shell with `poetry shell`
2. Install dependencies with `poetry install`

## Running a solution

Run a solution with `./solve --day N --part a|b`

If you want to run against the test case, add the `--test` flag, e.g. `./solve --day 1 --part b --test`
